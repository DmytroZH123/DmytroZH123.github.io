Hello everyone! I am an Applied Data Scientist, Artificial Intelligence Engineer, and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/). I graduated from [Kyiv National Economic University](https://kneu.edu.ua/) with a Bachelor's degree in System Analysis with distinction.

I have worked at the fast-growing cybersecurity company [Whalebone](https://www.whalebone.io/), which develops zero-disruption products for Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises, as a Threat Intelligence Specialist in Brno, Czech Republic. 
At present, I am working at [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/), Austria's largest research center dedicated exclusively to information security, as an R&D Cybersecurity Analyst in Vienna, Austria, alongside my studies.

During my Master's studies, I spent my time at [CERN](https://home.cern/) as a Visiting Summer Researcher, working on full-text retrieval in the full-text screening phase of the systematic review process within the [NeutrinoReview project](https://neutrino-review.web.cern.ch/). I conducted this research under the supervision of [Elias Sandner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=moQ6B8IAAAAJ&hl=en) (CERN) and [Christian Guetl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NoAiKpcAAAAJ&hl=de)
from the [Cognitive and Digital Science Lab](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/hcc/research/research-groups/cognitive-digital-science-lab/codis) (Technical University of Graz). Research output: 1 peer-reviewed article presented at a conference.

Research Interests: Human-Computer Interaction, Explainable and Transparent Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Random Processes, and Reinforcement Learning.

Skills: Proficiency in Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, Machine Learning Algorithms), Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch), Natural Language Processing (NLTK, spaCy, Gensim), Large Language Models (Transformers HF, Ollama, LangChain, Chroma), Data Mining (Beautiful Soup, Urllib3, Selenium), Data Analytics and Analysis (Python, Numpy, Pandas, Polars, Elasticsearch), Data Visualization (Plotly, Seaborn, Gradio, Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau, Kibana), Software Development (Git, Linux, Docker, Modal, Foundations of K8s and Rancher), Relational Databases (SQL, MySQL, SQL Server).
