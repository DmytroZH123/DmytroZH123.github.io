Hello everyone! I am an Applied Data Scientist, Artificial Intelligence Engineer, and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/). I graduated from [Kyiv National Economic University](https://kneu.edu.ua/) with a Bachelor's degree in System Analysis with distinction.

I have worked at the fast-growing cybersecurity company [Whalebone](https://www.whalebone.io/), which develops zero-disruption products for Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises, as a Threat Intelligence Specialist in Brno, Czech Republic. 
At present, I am working at [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/), Austria's largest research center dedicated exclusively to information security, as an R&D Cybersecurity Analyst in Vienna, Austria, alongside my studies.

During my Master's studies, I spent my time at [CERN](https://home.cern/) as a Visiting Summer Researcher, working on full-text retrieval in the full-text screening phase of the systematic review process within the [NeutrinoReview project](https://neutrino-review.web.cern.ch/). I conducted this research under the supervision of [Elias Sandner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=moQ6B8IAAAAJ&hl=en) (CERN) and [Christian Guetl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NoAiKpcAAAAJ&hl=de)
from the [Cognitive and Digital Science Lab](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/hcc/research/research-groups/cognitive-digital-science-lab/codis) (Technical University of Graz). Research output: 1 peer-reviewed article presented at a conference.

My research interests include but are not limited to: *Human-Computer Interaction, Explainable and Transparent Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Random Processes, and Reinforcement Learning*.

Communicative, responsible, problem-solving, teamwork, creative, have great attention to details, able to work both in team and independently. I have analytical thinking, persistent in achieving goals, and optimist myself. Also, I like jazz music, opera, Italian art, and travelling.
